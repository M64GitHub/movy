Thank you so much for your interest in **movy**!

movy is still growing and finding its shape.  
Right now the core systems, and API can be still changing as I refine ideas and explore what movy can become.

Because of that, it’s not quite ready for outside patches yet.  
But I love hearing ideas, questions, and impressions from anyone following the project — they help me see new perspectives and often inspire improvements.

If you’d like to share thoughts or discoveries, please open an **issue** or start a **discussion** here on GitHub.  
Once the core feels stable, I’ll share clear directions for collaborative development.

Thank you for caring about movy and for giving it your attention while it grows.
