Thank you a lot for your interest in **movy**!

movy is a personal, evolving project that I’m still actively developing and refining.  
At this stage, the architecture, rendering system, and API design are all moving rapidly,  
and I’m keeping the development direction tightly focused to maintain consistency and vision.

For now, **movy does not accept external code contributions or pull requests**.  
If you notice an issue, have an idea, or want to discuss potential improvements,  
please feel free to open an **issue** or start a **discussion** — I really appreciate insights,  
bug reports, and feedback.

Once the core stabilizes, I may gradually open the project for selected collaboration,  
but for the moment movy remains a single-maintainer effort.

Thank you for understanding and respecting the work, design, and care that go into  
building movy step by step.
