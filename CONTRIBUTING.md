Thank you so much for your interest in **movy**!

movy is a personal, evolving project that I’m actively developing and refining.  
The architecture, rendering system, and APIs are changing quickly, and I’m keeping the direction
tightly focused to maintain consistency and vision.

For now, **movy can not accept external code contributions or pull requests**.  
If you notice an issue, have an idea, or want to discuss potential improvements, please open an
**issue** or start a **discussion**. I truly appreciate insights and bug reports, and I’m happy to
coordinate—**please check in first** so efforts don’t overlap and any proposal can align with the
architecture and roadmap I have in mind.

Once the core stabilizes, I may gradually open selected collaboration.  
Until then, movy remains a single-maintainer effort.

Thank you for understanding and for respecting the care that goes into building movy step by step.
