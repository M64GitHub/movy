# movy Documentation

This folder contains user guide documentation for the movy terminal graphics rendering engine. Each document provides comprehensive tutorials on core structs and how to use them, written for developers new to movy.

## Available Documentation

- **[RenderSurface.md](./RenderSurface.md)** - The foundational struct for all visual content: creating surfaces, loading PNGs, adding text, and rendering to the terminal
- **[RenderEngine.md](./RenderEngine.md)** - The compositor: combining multiple surfaces with z-ordering, clipping, and alpha blending

## Status

This documentation is an ongoing process. More guides covering additional movy components will be added as development continues.
