# Hello World!

This is tzui! We just read a markdown file
into our StyledTextBuffer!

## Of course we can recognize UTF8 !! ★★★★
This is very *cool*!
But it is even cooler to go **bold**!

We also can do `inline code`, "strings", 
and also // comments 

### Here comes the code!

```zig
pub fn lalala(x: i32, y:i32) void {
  stdio.print("lalala {d}\n", .{ x });
  return;
}
```

```cpp
int main(int argc, char*[]argv)
{
  printf("lalalalala %d\n", argc);
  return 0;
}
```
