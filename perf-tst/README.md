# MOVY Performance Suite

I built this to be able to trace down and measure performance bottlenecks / -improvements.  

The performance suite tests three critical parts of the MOVY rendering pipeline: ANSI conversion, sprite rendering, and the combined render-to-ANSI flow. It runs 100-thousands of iterations, collects detailed metrics, and generates an interactive visualization dashboard so you can actually see what's going on.

## Quick Start

Run the full test suite:

```bash
zig build perf-runner
```

This takes a few minutes (it runs 100,000 iterations by default). When it's done, you'll get:
- JSON files with raw performance data in `perf-results/<timestamp>/`
- An automatically generated HTML dashboard at `perf-results/index.html`

Open the dashboard:

```bash
open perf-results/index.html
# or click in your file manager
```

You'll see a retro synthwave-themed dashboard with interactive charts showing throughput, and performance profiles across different sprite sizes and rendering configurations.

## What Gets Tested

The suite runs three test types, each targeting a specific part of the rendering pipeline:

### 1. RenderSurface.toAnsi
Tests ANSI conversion performance—how fast we can convert raw pixel data into terminal escape sequences.

**Tests sizes:** 10x10, 25x25, 50x50, 64x64, 100x100, 150x150, 200x200

**Why it matters:** ANSI conversion is our main bottleneck. Every frame needs to be converted before it hits the terminal, so this needs to be fast. The test shows how conversion time scales with sprite size.

### 2. RenderEngine.render_stable
Tests static (not moving / animating) sprite rendering performance—compositing multiple sprites into a single output surface.

**Tests configurations:**
- Square outputs: 64x64, 96x96, 128x128, 160x160, 192x192, 256x256
- 16:9 horizontal: Various widescreen sizes
- 9:16 vertical: Portrait-oriented sizes

**Why it matters:** This is the core rendering loop. It handles z-ordering, alpha blending, and pixel composition. Understanding how it scales across different output sizes and aspect ratios helps optimization.

### 3. RenderEngine.render_stable_with_toAnsi
Tests the full pipeline—render sprites AND convert to ANSI in one measurement.

**Uses same configurations as render_stable**

**Why it matters:** This is what happens in practice. Every frame needs both rendering and ANSI conversion, so measuring them together shows the true end-to-end performance. Comparing this with the individual tests reveals overhead and bottlenecks.

Each test run creates a new timestamped directory (e.g., `2025-11-19T14-33-08`). This makes it easy to compare runs over time or after code changes.

## Understanding the Dashboard

The visualization dashboard is designed around a simple idea: show everything that matters, make it easy to explore, and access the raw data.

### Navigation

Click the hamburger menu (top-right) to jump between sections:
- **Overview** - High-level stats and test descriptions
- **Benchmark Runs** - Table of all test runs with system info
- **Performance Charts** - Interactive visualizations
- **Raw Data** - Direct links to JSON files

The menu slides in from the left and closes when you click anywhere outside it, press Escape, or select a section.

### Chart Types

The dashboard includes several chart types, each showing a different perspective on performance:

**Per-Test Charts:**
- Line charts showing throughput (megapixels/sec) vs size
- Bar charts showing time per iteration
- Scatter plots revealing scaling behavior

**Comparison Charts** (comparing all three test types at 64x64):

1. **Simple Bar Chart** - Direct throughput comparison
   - Shows which test is fastest at a glance
   - Typically render_stable is 5-10x faster than the combined pipeline

2. **Grouped Bar Chart** - Multi-metric view with dual Y-axes
   - Left axis (cyan): Megapixels/sec and Speed Index
   - Right axis (magenta): Iterations/sec
   - Shows both throughput and latency characteristics
   - Dual axes solve the scale problem (iterations/sec is ~1000x larger than other metrics)

3. **Radar Chart** - Performance profile across 5 dimensions
   - Normalized metrics show relative strengths
   - Easy to see which test excels where
   - Good for presentations and high-level comparisons

### Interpreting Metrics

**Megapixels/sec (MP/sec)** - Higher is better
- Measures throughput: how many pixels processed per second
- Useful for comparing different implementations
- Scales with sprite/output size

**Iterations/sec** - Higher is better
- How many complete test iterations completed per second
- Better for comparing efficiency across different sizes
- More stable metric for micro-benchmarks

**Time per iteration (μs)** - Lower is better
- Latency metric: how long each iteration takes
- More intuitive for understanding frame budgets
- "Can I hit 60 FPS?" → Need < 16,667 μs per frame

**Speed Index** - Higher is better
- Computed as `(1 / time_per_iter_us) × 1000`
- Inverse of latency, normalized for visibility in charts
- Matches the intuition that "faster = higher"

## Advanced Usage

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Only test ANSI conversion
zig build perf-runner -- -tests "toAnsi"

# Test rendering only (skip ANSI conversion)
zig build perf-runner -- -tests "render_stable"

# Run multiple tests
zig build perf-runner -- -tests "toAnsi,render_stable"
```

### Custom Iteration Count

The default 100,000 iterations is thorough but might be slow on your system. Reduce it for quick checks:

```bash
# Fast run for development (still statistically valid)
zig build perf-runner -- -iterations 10000

# Very quick sanity check
zig build perf-runner -- -iterations 1000
```

Higher iteration counts give more stable numbers but take longer. 10,000 is usually enough for development work.

### Regenerating Visualizations

Made changes to the dashboard CSS or JavaScript? Regenerate the HTML without rerunning tests:

```bash
zig build perf-html-gen
```

This scans `perf-results/` for all test runs and rebuilds `index.html` with the updated styling and charts. Useful when tweaking the visualization or adding new chart types.

You can also run the generator directly with a custom directory:

```bash
./zig-out/bin/perf-html-gen my-custom-results
```

### Custom Output Directory

```bash
zig build perf-runner -- -output_dir my-results
```

Results will go to `my-results/<timestamp>/` instead of the default `perf-results/`.

## Technical Notes

### JSON Output Format

Each test produces a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "test_name": "RenderSurface.toAnsi",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-19T14-33-08",
  "system_info": {
    "cpu_model": "aarch64 (apple_m4)",
    "cpu_cores": 10,
    "os": "macos",
    "zig_version": "0.15.2",
    "build_mode": "ReleaseFast"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "64x64",
      "width": 64,
      "height": 64,
      "pixels": 4096,
      "iterations": 100000,
      "elapsed_ns": 5869437000,
      "time_per_iter_us": 58.69,
      "iter_per_sec": 17039.91,
      "megapixels_per_sec": 69.79
    }
  ]
}
```

All timing fields use high-precision measurements. The `elapsed_ns` field is the raw nanosecond count from `std.time.nanoTimestamp()`. Derived metrics are calculated to avoid rounding errors.

### Build Integration

The performance suite is fully integrated with the main MOVY build system:

- `perf-runner` - Runs tests and generates HTML
- `perf-html-gen` - Regenerates HTML only
- Individual test executables (for debugging):
  - `perf-RenderSurface.toAnsi`
  - `perf-RenderEngine.render_stable`
  - `perf-RenderEngine.render_stable_with_toAnsi`

All executables are built to `zig-out/bin/` and use `ReleaseFast` optimization.

### Adding New Tests

To add a new performance test:

1. Create a new test file in `perf-tst/tests/your_test.zig`
2. Implement the test structure (see existing tests as examples)
3. Add the test to `runner.zig` in the `available_tests` array
4. Update `build.zig` to build your test executable
5. Results will automatically appear in the dashboard

The visualization system is data-driven. As long as your test outputs the standard JSON format, charts will be generated automatically.

### Extending Visualizations

The dashboard uses Chart.js for rendering. To add new chart types:

1. Edit `web-assets/visualizer.js`
2. Add your chart rendering function
3. Call it from the appropriate section (e.g., `renderCharts()`)
4. Regenerate with `zig build perf-html-gen`

The embedded JSON data is available in JavaScript as `embeddedData[runKey]`, where each runKey is formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS"`. No need to deal with fetch() or CORS—everything's embedded directly in the HTML.

## Why These Specific Tests?

I picked these tests to answer specific questions:

**RenderSurface.toAnsi** → "How expensive is terminal output rendering?"
- ANSI conversion is pure overhead
- Can't be skipped in real usage
- Shows if we should cache ANSI strings or convert on-demand

**RenderEngine.render_stable** → "How fast is the core compositor?"
- No ANSI conversion noise in the measurements
- Tests z-ordering, alpha blending, pixel-level operations
- Different aspect ratios reveal cache and memory access patterns

**render_stable_with_toAnsi** → "What's the real-world performance?"
- Measures what actually happens in production
- Gap between this and sum of parts shows hidden overhead
- Helps identify optimization opportunities

## Interpreting Results

A few rules of thumb when looking at the data:

**Megapixels/sec increases with size?**
That's good. It means you're getting more efficient with larger sprites (better cache utilization, less per-pixel overhead).

**render_stable_with_toAnsi takes longer than render_stable + toAnsi separately?**
There's overhead in the combined pipeline.

**Big gap between 16:9 and square outputs?**
Memory layout matters. Might be worth profiling to see if certain sizes/strides perform better.

**Performance varies between runs?**
Make sure you're in ReleaseFast mode and nothing else is hogging the CPU. Also check if your test is too short (increase iterations).

## So ...

The visualization dashboard is self-contained HTML/CSS/JS with no build dependencies. If you want to customize it, just edit the files in `web-assets/` and regenerate. The code is commented and follows standard Chart.js patterns.

Happy benchmarking!
